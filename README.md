## Tower Trace (32× speedup)

Trace over Galois subgroup $H = \langle \sigma_{-1}, \sigma_{4k+1} \rangle$:

```
Naive:  Tr_H(x) = Σ_{σ∈H} σ(x)              → 256 automorphisms
Tower:  Tr_H(x) = (1+σ_{g₁})...(1+σ_{g₈})(x) → 8 automorphisms
```

Exploits index-2 subgroup tower for 2-groups. Measured 31.7× speedup (d=1024, k=4).

## Rejection Sampling

Rejection sampling for zero-knowledge applications.

## Usage

```bash
cargo test --release
cargo bench
```
